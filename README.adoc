# Open-source firmware for an stm32-based "cnc3018 offline controller"

This popular chineese (most probably) controller is frequently sold with 3018-type CNC machines.
The machines themselves run GRBL on ATmega328 MCUs, while the controller uses STM32F103C8T6 MCU.
The stock firmware is somewhat lacking in features (no DROs, no spindle speed, for example).

While the goal of this project is to make an alternative to control a CNC machine, it can be also useful for those who want to turn this controller into something else (a small gaming console, a controller for other equipment). 

The firmware is written for Arduino framework and PlatformIO build system. 
VS Code IDE is used for development.

## Goals of the project:

. Reverse-engineer the schematic of the board (to the required extent)
. Make custom firmware with these features:
.. Move axes via buttons, display coordinates on screen, etc.
.. Send gcode from files on SD card.
.. Stream gcode from USB.

# Schematic ans hardware

The schematic reversing is mostly complete. 
Everything that's needed to interface from MCU (pins, interfaces) is known.
