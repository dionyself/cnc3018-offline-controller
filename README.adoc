# Open-source firmware for an STM32-based "cnc3018 offline controller"

image::controller.png[display,300]

This popular chineese (most probably) controller is frequently sold with 3018-type CNC machines.
The machines themselves run GRBL on ATmega328 MCUs, while the controller uses STM32F103 MCU.
The stock firmware is somewhat lacking in features (no DROs, no spindle speed, for example).

The goal of this project is to make an alternative firmware to control a CNC machine.
The information provided can be also useful for those who want to turn this controller into something else (a small gaming console, a controller for other equipment). 

The firmware is written for Arduino framework and PlatformIO build system. 
VS Code IDE is used for development.

## Goals of the project:

. Reverse-engineer the schematic of the board (to the required extent)
. Make custom firmware with these features:
.. Move axes via buttons, display coordinates on screen, etc.
.. Send gcode from files on SD card.
.. Stream gcode from USB.

## Schematic and hardware

The schematic reversing is mostly complete. 
Everything that's needed to interface with MCU (pins, interfaces) is known.

The board features:

* STM32F103C8T6 MCU. 
  64K Flash, 20K RAM
* 128x64 OLED display with SSD1306 IC. 
  2-color, 16 rows yellow, rest cyan.
  Connected via 4-wire software SPI.
* Mini USB (no external crystal, so not datasheet-compliant).
* Full size SD card socket. SPI interface is wired out.
* 8-pin IDC connector for CNC machine. 
  Has 5V, GND, UART and USB detection pin 
  (when CNC is connected to PC via its own USB-UART, the controller indicates that and does not communicate over UART).
* 8 buttons. 
  Buttons short MCU pin to ground, internal pullup required.
* An unpopulated SWD socket
